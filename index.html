                            The depth in the children's part is 80 cm, and in the large part it varies from 130 cm to 160 cm at the end of the pool.
                            In the pool area, guests can take advantage of both the poolbar which is meters from the pool and our VIP tents, which are located in our flower garden around the pool.
                            This area is isolated and guests can feel completely at ease and in privacy.
                            The area is large enough to provide the maximum number of our guests with sunbeds and umbrellas to enjoy their holiday around the pool</p>
